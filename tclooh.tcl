## \brief A mixin object that defines "public variable" behaviour of Itcl.
# 
# Defines methods [configure] and [cget], which are used to set and get the 
# values of public variables. This is done by calls like
# [obj configure -varname1 value -varname2 value] and [obj cget -varname] 
# respectively (with a dash in front of the variable name). The configuration
# or cget occurs on an object variable name without the dash.
# 
# Constructors can also be called with the variables, and usually there is a 
# traditional call to [eval configure $args] in every constructor of an Itcl
# object. Since this has been repetitive all the time, we can now let
# the mixin object do it automatically.

    # a dash as first character), then no configuration is done!

## \brief A meta class for default variable assignment and inheritance
#
# When defining classes, it is almost always very convenient to assigns 
# default values, like 
# 
# 'variable varname value'
# 'variabel varname {}'
#
# These default values should be assigned during object construction, so
# that they are available in every method if not defined to be something 
# else and it is not always necessary to check for existence before using
# the variables.
# Additionally the variables and defaults shall be installed automatically
# in derived classes (but not in mixins)

    # destroys the object when the variable is overwritten or unset. This has
    # the side effect that an object which was created using [varcreate] inside
    # a procedure or method is automatically destroyed when the variable is
    # local (but not when the variable is global, it is a namespace variable or
    # hooked up by upvar / namespace upvar). It has also the effect that the
    # objects destructor is called when the object was varcreate'd in a slave
    # interpreter and this interp is deleted.
